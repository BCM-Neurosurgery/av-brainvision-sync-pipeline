Quick guide
-----------
• Step = ids[i+1] - ids[i]; expected step E = 1.
• ok           : diff == E    → values increase as expected.
• duplicate    : diff == 0    → adjacent repeated value (no increase).
• forward_jump : diff >  E    → skipped/missing values;
                  Total missing IDs = sum(diff - E) over all forward jumps.
• drop         : diff <  E    → value decreased (e.g., reset/rollover).
• Counts       : number of steps in each category (there are N-1 steps for N values).

Values=18000  Steps=17999  ok=17999 (100.00%)
Counts: ok=17999
Longest OK segment: start=0  length=17999 steps
