# Video Sync Pipeline

This site covers two A/V sync CLIs:

- **NBU A/V Sync (`cli_nbu`)** — Jamail/NBU recordings with serial-bearing audio.
- **EMU A/V Sync (`cli_emu_time`)** — EMU tasks using NS5/NEV audio plus camera MP4/JSON.

Start with **Getting Started → Which CLI should I use?** to pick the right path,
then follow the corresponding quick start and I/O layouts.
